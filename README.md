# yourfirstcommit

The web app displays GitHub repo history starting from the very first commit. (yeah, in ascending order)

### MVP features

- main page with the search bar only (look at npm.io or npms.io as UI/UX alternative);
- you put any GitHub repo URL (or even only `author/repo` path) into the search bar;
- show list of commits starting from the very first;
